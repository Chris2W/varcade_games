# Mouse and Keyboard

I'm going to go ahead and assume you know what a mouse and keyboard are and what they do. So you might be wondering why I'd bother writing a whole post about them.

Well, what I actually want to do is get you excited about your keyboard... and learn to despise your mouse. Maybe despise is too strong a word... mice are great and absolutely have a place. But if you're going to be spending a lot of time with your computer, it's worth really getting to know your keyboard.

But why? You might ask.

Let's think about it for a second. 

When you are sitting at your computer and writing some code or typing up a document, you will have both of your hands on the keyboard. 

If you then want to use your mouse to do something, like change to a different window or select a menu option, you need to lift your hand off the keyboard and move it over to the mouse. Then you need to move that mouse so that your pointer moves to the desired location. Finally, you can click the thing.

This is slow. More often than not you can avoid that hand relocation entirely using keyboard shortcuts. More on that below.

But that's not the only reason it is slow. 

When using a keyboard you can use all ten of your fingers together to produce a serious amount of inputs to your computer. The average mouse has two buttons and a scroll wheel. That's three inputs. So you are wasting two whole fingers!

On your key board you can learn to use all of your fingers in a sort of ten finger ballet. The amount of information you can send to your computer through your keyboard vastly outweighs the information you can send via a mouse.

You just need to learn how to do it.


## Touch Typing

First of all - touch typing. The ability to type without looking at the keyboard.

This is an invaluable skill and worth spending some time on. I won't lie, it can be painful, but there are plenty of tools online to help you improve your typing. My personal favourite is a version of the arcade shooter 'House of the Dead' called 'The Typing of the Dead', where you type words to fend off an incoming horde of zombies.
