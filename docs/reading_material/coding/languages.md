# Programming Languages

> What programming language should I learn first?

This is possibly the most common question I see from beginners. 

I also see that question's cousin quite a bit:

> What is the best programming language for beginners.

And like most questions, the right, but unsatisfying, answer is `it depends`.

## What does it depend on?

It depends on a lot of things.

On you.

On your goals and interests.

On your knowledge of and experience with computers.

Maybe you're passionate about the Web and want to spend the rest of your life building web sites that users love using.

Or maybe you want to be a game developer, so you plan to create stunningly realistic 3D graphics simulations. 

Perhaps AI and Machine Learning tickles your fancy. 

I might recommend a different learning path for each of the above, which is why `what programming language should I learn first` is a difficult question to answer.

Regardless of all of that, however, there are some pieces of advice that I'd give to anyone, regardless of their goals and interests.

## Fundamentals

"Focus on the fundamentals."

People say this all the time - and it seems to me to be true in all things.

If you can't do the simple things well, what hope have you got doing more complex things?

But this statement does beg the question: "What are the fundamentals?"

And depending on who you ask you might get a different answer.

This is because we tend to think of programming, computer science, software engineering, web development etc... as all being the same thing, when really there are some differences.

So lets define some of these things.

* **Computer Science** - The study of computation and computer technology, hardware, and software.

* **Programming** - The process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs.

* **Software Engineering** - The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches. That is the application of engineering to software.

* **Web Development** - Building, creating, and maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design , web publishing , web programming, and database management.

So as you can see there are some differences. Some are subtle, like the difference between programming and software engineering. Programming is definitely a part of software engineering, it's how we create software in the first place, but it is more than just programming.

Computer science is very much concerned with the hardware and low level details of how a computer works, but web development is more focused on what a web browser can do, rather than what a computer can do.

Web development could be considered a specialization of software engineering and also requires programming.

The waters here appear pretty muddy, but these distinctions are important as they will impact where you focus your energy. 

Let's get back to the fundamentals. I think it's worth defining some fundamentals for each, but it's important to note that different people may have different opinions on this, and what follows is just my opinion.

### Computer Science

These are all low level topics and I think most programmers should endeavor to get at least a basic understanding of most of them. 

If you want to work on low level software like operating systems, databases, embedded systems or game engines you should probably have a good understanding of all of these.

* Hardware design
* Logic & Binary arithmetic
* **Data structures & Algorithms**
* **Computational complexity**
* Compiler design

I have highlighted `Data Structures and Algorithms` and `Computational Complexity` here, as I think these are the most important topics for generalists to have a good understanding of.

### Programming

* Logic
* Control flow
* Configuration management
* Standard lib
* Memory management (yes - even in memory managed languages)
* Data modelling
* Abstraction
* Modularity
* Testing
* Refactoring
* Profiling / performance analysis

### Software Engineering

* System design
* System analysis
* Continuous integration
* Code management
* Deployment / release management
* Version management

### Web Development

* HTML
* Dom structure
* Javascript
* SQL
* Web security

## Don't be an X developer

I don't like the idea of being a 'Python developer' or a 'C++ developer'.

People do this with frameworks too. "I'm a React developer" or "I'm an IOS developer".

I think you should avoid pigeonholing yourself like this. 

Become a developer, or a software engineer, a programmer. 

Over your career you will be exposed to many new technologies and you will have to learn and adapt constantly.

Focus on concepts and ideas instead of specific technologies. Find patterns and commonalities in what you are doing. Think critically about the technologies you are using.

This will allow you to pick up the right tool for the job when you need it.

None of this means you can't become an expert in one thing. I'd just avoid limiting yourself to that one thing.

There is a saying you sometimes here that goes like this:

>A jack of all trades is a master of none.

This makes it seems as if knowing a little about a lot of things is bad. However, the full original saying actually goes like this:

>A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.

In other words - generalists are often more useful than specialists.

## Pick something and finish it



## Final Thoughts

I'm sure I'll write more on this topic in the future - but in general I like to do things in threes. It's a nice manageable number. You can fit three things neatly in your head.
