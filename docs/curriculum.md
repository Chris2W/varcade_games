In the pages that follow we will explore a range of different topics related to software engineering.

Hardware, software, coding and of course work on a real world project.

A combination of reading and doing.

The menu on your left will provide you with reading material that covers various different software engineering related topics as well as detailed guides on how to work with Varcade Games, along with some tasks for you to do yourself.

## Reading Material

This section covers many different but important topics related to computers and software engineering.

Some of it technical, some of it more philosophical. 

The goal here is to help you really understand what is actually going on inside your computer and to get you thinking like a software engineer.

## Your Internship

This section is all about Varcade Games.

How to set up your development environment, how to configure the product and how to make changes.

This is where you will experience what it is like to be a software engineer out there in the real world.

## An important Note

This will be an ever-evolving curriculum. 

The project will grow and shift over time and new reading material will be added.

You will find this is exactly what happens in the software industry. 

Nothing is static - and you will need to get used to that fact pretty quickly.

## What's next?

I recommend jumping straight in to your internship.

The 'Getting Set Up' and 'Onboarding' documentation will guide you through the process of downloading the project code and running it on your machine.

As soon as you start that process you will be learning.

If you get frustrated or want a break from the hands on side of things then jump over to the reading material.

If you want some human support you can join me over on our dedicated [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kCpFSeEx).

Most importantly - have fun!
