# Code Over Time

Code Over Time is all about software engineering. It’s about building production ready software that can be maintained and extended over time. Building a real product.

In order to be an effective Software Engineer you need to face the challenges that releasing software brings. You need real hands on experience.

Software Engineering is a skill and it is more than just coding.

It involves managing a system as it evolves over time. That system will have many different components, all interconnected. It will behave differently when many people are using it and it will break from time to time.

There are a lot of variables at play here – a lot of tech to learn and understand.

Over the course of two decades in the software industry I’ve seen and heard of countless junior engineers experiencing explosive growth during their first six months working in the real world. I’ve also heard from many experienced engineers that they experience most growth when changing job or project.

Code Over Time aims to simulate that experience. To give you something real to work on – and to get you off the rails of coding tutorials.

Here you will have your own project to manage, features to build and bugs to fix.

I have a quote that I think sums this up nicely:

```
“Education is experience, and the essence of experience is self-reliance.”

-Merlyn, ‘The Sword in the Stone’
```

## Varcade Games

You will work on a production ready product called ‘Varcade Games’

It is an online gaming portal that allows game developers build and share their games while also taking advantage of built in functionality, such as a matchmaker and leaderboard.

The tech behind this product is a set of containerised micro services with build and deploy scripts and load tests, units tests and static analysis. Everything you’d expect from a real world project.

You can test it our yourself on our Varcade Games dev server.

## The Tech

In order to work on this project we’ll primarily use Python and Javascript.

You’ll also be working with popular tech like Vue.js, Node.js, Django and Flask along with DevOps tech like Docker and Kubernetes

Everything you need to be a well rounded engineer.

## Open Source

This project is open source and you are free to go take a look at the code right now!

There are detailed READMEs there that explain how everything works. Though that will be more useful to more experienced engineers.

Code Over Time provides more support through self guided courses, documentation, hands on work and forums to help you learn how all of this works.





## Who is Code Over Time for?

### Beginner - Intermediate Coders

Have you learned how to write a bit of code? Maybe done a couple of small projects and followed some courses online or completed a year or two of college?

Code Over Time is primarily for you.

The goal is to give you some hands on experience with the type of project you might actually see when you get your first engineering job.

Hopefully it also helps you uncover what you’re actually interested in. Is it server programming? Automation? DevOps? Graphics?

On this project you will get to dip your toe in a number of different specialties to see which one fits you best.

### Engineers changing field

Been working primarily in Java and looking for get a Python job?

Or doing a lot of front end web stuff but want to understand what is going on with the backend?

Or maybe you want to make the jumps to DevOps and need some hands on experience with Kubernetes.

With Code Over Time and Varcade Games you can build the skills you will need for changing your specialty.

### Experienced engineers

Are you and experienced engineer that wants to try your hand at Python? Maybe you’ve never done web development and want to try out some of that tech.

With Code Over Time you’ve got a real project to jump into and experience those things first hand.

It’s also a great tool for learning new tech.

Interested in learning GoLang? Try rewriting one of the Varcade Games services in Go to experience the language with real world use cases.

Maybe you want to understand Docker a bit better – there’s plenty of opportunity for that too.

Maybe you like making games and would like to plug into and existing framework for hosting it and running multi-player games.

Basically what you’ve got is a sandbox, and sitting there on Github waiting for you.

You will need less support in understanding what is going on of course, but the forum will still be a great place to connect with other engineers, maybe share project ideas.

### The Curious

Interested in tech? Patient and willing to put in hours of work?

You might find exploring Varcade Games fun.

Get in and change things, see what happens.

Hack at it and have fun.
