# Programming Languages

> What programming language should I learn first?

This is possibly the most common question I see from beginners. 

I also see that question's cousin quite a bit:

> What is the best programming language for beginners.

And like most questions, the right, but unsatisfying, answer is `it depends`.

## What does it depend on?

It depends on a lot of things.

On you.

On your goals and interests.

On your knowledge of and experience with computers.

Maybe you're passionate about the Web and want to spend the rest of your life building web sites that users love using.

Or maybe you want to be a game developer, so you plan to create stunningly realistic 3D graphics simulations. 

Perhaps AI and Machine Learning tickles your fancy. 

I might recommend a different learning path for each of the above.

But regardless of all of that - there are some pieces of advice that I'd give to everyone, regardless of their goals and interests.

## Fundamentals

"Focus on the fundamentals."

People say this all the time - and it seems to me to be true in all things.

If you can't do the simple things well, what hope have you got doing more complex things?

But this statement begs the question: "But what are the fundamentals?"

And that is a hard question to answer.

In software engineering I'd include the following when thinking about fundamentals:

### Abstraction


### Modularity


### Complexity


## Don't be an X developer

I don't like the idea of being a 'Python developer' or a 'C++ developer'.

People do this with frameworks too. "I'm a React developer" or "I'm an IOS developer".

I think you should avoid pigeonholing yourself like this. 

Become a developer, or a software engineer, a programmer. 

Over your career you will be exposed to many new technologies and you will have to learn and adapt constantly.

Focus on concepts and ideas instead of specific technologies. Find patterns and commonalities in what you are doing. Think critically about the technologies you are using.

This will allow you to pick up the right tool for the job when you need it.

None of this means you can't become an expert in one thing. I'd just avoid limiting yourself to that one thing.

There is a saying you sometimes here that goes like this:

>A jack of all trades is a master of none.

This makes it seems as if knowing a little about a lot of things is bad. However, the full original saying actually goes like this:

>A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.

In other words - generalists are often more useful than specialists.

## Pick something and finish it



## Final Thoughts

I'm sure I'll write more on this topic in the future - but in general I like to do things in threes. It's a nice manageable number. You can fit three things neatly in your head.
